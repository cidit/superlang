# SuperLang
> "one language to rule them all"

## SuperLang is my take on an opinionated language
im compiling all of the cool things i found in all the other languages i know
and sprinkling some features of my own. notable inspirations include but are not limited to: Python, Java/Kotlin, Javascript/Typescript

# expample syntax:
here's a little taste of what you can expect to see
```
fun foo(str a, num b) -> bool {
    val c <- a.len lower or equals b
    if c:
        if a.len not equals b:
            print(f"a's)
        print(f"a is not of length {b}")
    else:
        print(f"a's length is greater than {b}")
    return c
}
```
